        about_content: `Hi, my name is Yossi.
Electrician and ____ since ____. Being independent is not easy. I myself have gone through a lot of frustrations during my years as a freelancer. I didn't have enough money to keep an employee/s, work was not continuous throughout the year, difficulty taking short and long vacation days, there was simply no one to provide regular service to all my clients. Then I realized, I'm not the only one and like me, many other independent electricians live with this frustration. So I created a platform that brings together all electricians in one place and serves a common interest. Together, we will create a tremendous force of helping each other. Posting jobs and receiving job offers from electricians in the area. An hourly price list that will be acceptable to anyone who joins as a member. Mutual agreements with other professionals so that we can use them in a more organized way. Basically, everything you need to make it easier for all of us and create something like never before!`,
